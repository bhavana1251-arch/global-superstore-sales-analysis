### 💼 Business Problem  
Retailers often struggle with inventory misallocation, regional underperformance, and unclear product trends.  
The challenge: **Which regions and product categories are underperforming?**  
And: **How can pricing and promotion strategies be optimized?**

Key business questions addressed:  
- Which regions are lagging in sales and why?  
- Which product lines have the highest profit vs volume?  
- What seasonal or trend patterns emerge across markets?

> 💡 *Analyst mindset:*  
> This project demonstrates how retail datasets can be turned into actionable insights to drive strategy, not just descriptive metrics.
