## 💡 **Key Insights**
1. **Total Sales:** ₹12.6M | **Total Profit:** ₹1.47M | **Profit Margin:** 11.6%  
2. **Technology & Office Supplies** are highly profitable, but **Furniture (Tables)** shows poor margins.  
3. **Consumer segment** contributes over 50% of total revenue.  
4. **West region** has highest sales, while **East region** shows strongest margins.  
5. Over-discounting (>20%) directly reduces profit — discounts above 40% almost always create losses.  
6. A few **top customers** account for ~15% of all revenue (Pareto pattern).  
7. **Standard shipping** has most volume but lowest margins.  
8. **Seasonal spikes** occur in Q4 (Nov–Dec), signaling prime sales periods.
